# DeepLearningNLP
Implementation of cutting-edge NLP and Deep Learning methods for solving practical machine learning problems.


NLP Codes with TensorFlow and Trax
This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) codes implemented using the TensorFlow and Trax frameworks. The codes are built using deep learning techniques to solve various NLP tasks.<br>

# Introduction

Greetings, I am Harsh Kulkarni, ML Enthusiast.
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks created with cutting-edge NLP and Deep Learning methods to solve practical machine learning problems.TensorFlow and Trax are two popular frameworks used for building deep learning models. The repository currently includes the following solutions to the following problems:<br>


1. Sentiment analysis<br>
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER)<br>

Each code example is well-documented and includes instructions on how to use it effectively.<br>

# Installation
You need to install the necessary dependencies to run the NLP codes in this repository.

Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash<br>
Copy code<br>
```
$git clone https://github.com/Infinity1105/DeepLearningNLP
```



# Usage
Each code example in this repository is self-contained and can be run independently. You can just navigate to the respective directory for the NLP task you are interested in.<br>

Before running the codes, make sure you have downloaded any required datasets or pre-trained models mentioned in the instructions.

# Models
The NLP codes in this repository utilize various deep-learning models provided by TensorFlow and Trax. Some popular models include:

1. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)<br>
2. GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)<br>

The models are implemented and configured within the code examples, and you can modify them as per your requirements.
