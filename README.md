Introduction
In this repository, you will find Python code examples to solve various real-world problems using deep learning techniques for NLP tasks. TensorFlow and Trax are two popular frameworks used for building deep learning models. The codes cover a wide range of NLP tasks, including:


Sentiment analysis
Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Each code example is well-documented and includes instructions on how to use it effectively.

Installation
You need to install the necessary dependencies to run the NLP codes in this repository.

Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Infinity1105/DeepLearningNLP

Usage
Each code example in this repository is self-contained and can be run independently. You can just navigate to the respective directory for the NLP task you are interested in.

Before running the codes, make sure you have downloaded any required datasets or pre-trained models mentioned in the instructions.

Models
The NLP codes in this repository utilize various deep-learning models provided by TensorFlow and Trax. Some popular models include:

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)

The models are implemented and configured within the code examples, and you can modify them as per your requirements.
